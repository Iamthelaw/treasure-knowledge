#+TITLE: Treasure collection of links and scrapes

Mostly it is just another collection of programming-related stuff
that I collect over years.

In a big picture it consist of Python and Django related stuff, such as
code examples, articles, videos and so on.

Recently I installed emacs, and you know - org-mode is steal my heart.
